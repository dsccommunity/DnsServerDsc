    .SYNOPSIS
        The DnsServerRecursion DSC resource manages recursion settings on a Microsoft
        Domain Name System (DNS) server.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The DnsServerRecursion DSC resource manages recursion settings on a Microsoft
        Domain Name System (DNS) server. Recursion occurs when a DNS server queries
        other DNS servers on behalf of a requesting client, and then sends the answer
        back to the client.

        The property `SecureResponse` that can be set by the cmdlet `Set-DnsServerRecursion`
        changes the same value as `EnablePollutionProtection` in the resource _DnsServerCache_
        does. Use the property `EnablePollutionProtection` in the resource _DnsServerCache_
        to enforce pollution protection.

    .PARAMETER DnsServer
        The host name of the Domain Name System (DNS) server, or use `'localhost'`
        for the current node.

    .PARAMETER Enable
        Specifies whether the server enables recursion.

    .PARAMETER AdditionalTimeout
        Specifies the time interval, in seconds, that a DNS server waits as it uses
        recursion to get resource records from a remote DNS server. Valid values are
        in the range of `1` second to `15` seconds. See recommendation in the documentation
        of [Set-DnsServerRecursion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dnsserver/set-dnsserverrecursion).

    .PARAMETER RetryInterval
        Specifies elapsed seconds before a DNS server retries a recursive lookup.
        Valid values are in the range of `1` second to `15` seconds. The
        recommendation is that in general this value should not be change. However,
        under a few circumstances it can be considered changing the value. For
        example, if a DNS server contacts a remote DNS server over a slow link and
        retries the lookup before it gets a response, it could help to raise the
        retry interval to be slightly longer than the observed response time.
        See recommendation in the documentation of [Set-DnsServerRecursion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dnsserver/set-dnsserverrecursion).

    .PARAMETER Timeout
        Specifies the number of seconds that a DNS server waits before it stops
        trying to contact a remote server. The valid value is in the range of `1`
        second to `15` seconds. Recommendation is to increase this value when
        recursion occurs over a slow link. See recommendation in the documentation
        of [Set-DnsServerRecursion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dnsserver/set-dnsserverrecursion).

    .NOTES
        The cmdlet Set-DsnServerRecursion allows to set the value 0 (zero) for the
        properties AdditionalTimeout, RetryInterval, and Timeout, but setting the
        value 0 reverts the property to its respectively default value. The default
        value for the properties on Windows Server 2016 is 4 seconds for property
        AdditionalTimeout, 3 seconds for RetryInterval, and 8 seconds for property
        Timeout. If it was allowed to set 0 (zero) as the value in this resource
        for these properties then the state would never become in desired state.
