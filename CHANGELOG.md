The format is based on and uses the types of changes according to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- xDnsRecord
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The resource has been replaced by _DnsServerA_, _DnsServerPtr_,
  and _DnsServerCName_ ([issue #221](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/221)).
- xDnsServerMx
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The resource has been replaced by _DnsServerMx_ ([issue #228](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/228)).
- DnsServerSetting
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The properties `Forwarders` and `ForwardingTimeout` has
    been removed ([issue #192](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/192)).
    Use the resource _DnsServerForwarder_ to enforce these properties.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The properties `EnableEDnsProbes` and `EDnsCacheTimeout` has
    been removed ([issue #195](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/195)).
    Use the resource _DnsServerEDns_ to enforce these properties.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The properties `SecureResponses`, `MaxCacheTTL`, and
    `MaxNegativeCacheTTL` has been removed ([issue #197](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/197)).
    To enforce theses properties, use resource _DnsServerEDns_ using the
    properties `EnablePollutionProtection`, `MaxTtl`, and `MaxNegativeTtl`
    respectively.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The properties `DefaultAgingState`, `ScavengingInterval`,
    `DefaultNoRefreshInterval`, and `DefaultRefreshInterval` have been removed.
    Use the resource _DnsServerScavenging_ to enforce this properties ([issue #193](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/193)).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The properties `NoRecursion`, `RecursionRetry`, and
    `RecursionTimeout` has been removed ([issue #200](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/200)).
    To enforce theses properties, use resource _DnsServerRecursion_ using the
    properties `Enable`, `RetryInterval`, and `Timeout` respectively.
- ResourceBase
  - For the method `Get()` the overload that took a `[Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance]`
    was removed as it is not the correct pattern going forward.

### Added

- DnsServerDsc
  - Added new resource
    - _DnsServerCache_ - resource to enforce cache settings ([issue #196](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/196)).
    - _DnsServerRecursion_ - resource to enforce recursion settings ([issue #198](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/198)).
  - Added new private function `Get-ClassName` that returns the class name
    or optionally an array with the class name and all inherited base class
    named.
  - Added new private function `Get-LocalizedDataRecursive` that gathers
    all localization strings from an array of class names. This can be used
    in classes to be able to inherit localization strings from one or more
    base class. If a localization string key exist in a parent class's
    localization string file it will override the localization string key
    in any base class.
- ResourceBase
  - Added new method `Assert()` tha calls `Assert-Module` and `AssertProperties()`.

### Changed

- DnsServerDsc
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed the module to DnsServerDsc ([issue #179](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/179)).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed the prefix 'x' from all MOF-based resources
    ([issue #179](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/179)).
  - Renamed a MOF-based resource to use the prefix 'DSC' ([issue #225](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/225)).
  - Fix stub `Get-DnsServerResourceRecord` so it throws if it is not mocked
    correctly ([issue #204](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/204)).
  - Switch the order in the deploy pipeline so that creating the GitHub release
    is made after a successful release.
  - Updated stub function to throw if they are used (instead of being mocked)
    ([issue #235](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/235)).
- ResourceBase
  - Added support for inherit localization strings and also able to override
    a localization string that exist in a base class.
  - Moved more logic from the resources into the base class for the method
    `Test()`, `Get()`, and `Set()`. The base class now have three methods
    `AssertProperties()`, `Modify()`, and `GetCurrentState()` where the
    two latter ones must be overridden by a resource if calling the base
    methods `Set()` and `Get()`.
  - Moved the `Assert-Module` from the constructor to a new method `Assert()`
    that is called from `Get()`, `Test()`, and `Set()`. The method `Assert()`
    also calls the method `AssertProperties()`. The method `Assert()` is not
    meant to be overridden, but can if there is a reason not to run
    `Assert-Module` and or `AssertProperties()`.
- Integration tests
  - Added commands in the DnsRecord* integration tests to wait for the LCM
    before moving to the next test.
- DnsServerCache
  - Moved to the same coding pattern as _DnsServerRecursion_.
- DnsServerEDns
  - Moved to the same coding pattern as _DnsServerRecursion_.
- DnsServerScavenging
  - Moved to the same coding pattern as _DnsServerRecursion_.

  - Update pipeline files.
  - Renamed the default branch to `main` ([issue #131](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/131)).
  - Uses `PublishPipelineArtifact` in  _Azure Pipelines_ pipeline.
  - Unit tests are now run in PowerShell 7 in the _Azure Pipelines_
    pipeline ([issue #160](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/160)).

  - Only add required role in integration tests pipeline.
  - Updated the pipeline to use new deploy tasks.
  - Revert back to using the latest version of module Sampler for the pipeline ([issue #211](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/211)).
  - Fixed the sections in the GitHub issue and pull request templates to
    have a bit higher font size. This makes it easier to distinguish the
    section headers from the text.
- DnsRecordBase
  - Changed class to inherit properties from 'ResourcePropertiesBase`.

    unit test to clone the existing DNS record instead of using the method
    `Clone()` that does not exist in PowerShell 7.
- xDnsServerSetting
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The mandatory parameter was replaced by the mandatory
    parameter `DnsServer`. This prevents the resource from being used twice
    in the same configuration using the same value for the parameter `DnsServer`
    ([issue #156](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/156)).
- xDnsServerDiagnostics
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The mandatory parameter was replaced by the mandatory
    parameter `DnsServer`. This prevents the resource from being used twice
    in the same configuration using the same value for the parameter `DnsServer`
    ([issue #157](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/157)).
- xDnsServerPrimaryZone
  - Now the property `Name` is always returned from `Get-TargetResource`
    since it is a `Key` property.
- xDnsServerForwarder
  - When providing an empty collection the resource will enforce that no
    forwarders are present.
- DnsRecordSrv
  - Changed logic for calculating the record's hostname

### Removed

- xDnsServer
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The DSC resource xDnsARecord was removed and are replaced
    by the DSC resource xDnsRecord.
  - Removing resource parameter information from README.md in favor of
    GitHub repository wiki.
  - Remove helper function `Remove-CommonParameter` in favor of the one in
    module _DscResource.Common_ ([issue #166](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/166)).
  - Remove helper function `ConvertTo-CimInstance` in favor of the one in
    module _DscResource.Common_ ([issue #167](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/167)).
  - Remove helper function `ConvertTo-HashTable` in favor of the one in
    module _DscResource.Common_ ([issue #168](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/168)).
- xDnsServerSetting
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The properties `LogIPFilterList`, `LogFilePath`, `LogFileMaxSize`,
    and `EventLogLevel` have been removed. Use the resource _xDnsServerDiagnostics_
    with the properties `FilterIPAddressList`, `LogFilePath`, `MaxMBFileSize`,
    and `EventLogLevel` respectively to enforce these settings ([issue #190](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DnsServerDsc/issues/190)).
    This is done in preparation to support more settings through the cmdlet
    `Get-DnsServerSetting` for the resource _xDnsServerSetting_, and these
    values are not available through that cmdlet.
