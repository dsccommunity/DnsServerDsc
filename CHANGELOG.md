The format is based on and uses the types of changes according to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Deprecated

- **The module _xDnsServer_ will be renamed _DnsServerDsc_. Version `2.0.0`
  will be the the last release of _xDnsServer_. Version `3.0.0` will be
  release as _DnsServerDsc_, it will be released shortly after the `2.0.0`
  release** ([issue #179](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/179)).
  The prefix 'x' will be removed from all resources in _DnsServerDsc_.
- xDnsRecord will be removed in the next release (of DnsServerDsc) ([issue #220](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/220)).
  Start migrate to the resources _DnsRecord*_.
- The properties `DefaultAgingState`, `ScavengingInterval`, `DefaultNoRefreshInterval`,
  and `DefaultRefreshInterval` will be removed from the resource xDnsServerSetting
  in the next release (of DnsServerDsc).
  Migrate to use the resource _DnsServerScavenging_ to enforce these properties.
- The properties `EnableEDnsProbes` and `EDnsCacheTimeout` will be removed from
  the resource xDnsServerSetting in the next release (of DnsServerDsc) ([issue #195](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/195)).
  Migrate to use the resource _DnsServerEDns_ to enforce these properties.

      with the latest version before published to GitHub repository wiki.
  - Updated the prerequisites in the GitHub repository wiki (`Home.md`)
    that _Microsoft DNS Server_ is required on a node targeted by a resource,
    and that the DSC resources requires the [DnsServer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dnsserver)
    PowerShell module ([issue #37](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/37)).

### Changed

- xDnsServer
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Set the minimum required PowerShell version to 5.0 to support classes used in the DnsRecordBase-derived resources.
  - Resolve style guideline violations for hashtables
  - Update pipeline files.
  - Renamed the default branch to `main` ([issue #131](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/131)).
  - Uses `PublishPipelineArtifact` in  _Azure Pipelines_ pipeline.
  - Unit tests are now run in PowerShell 7 in the _Azure Pipelines_
    pipeline ([issue #160](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/160)).
  - Merged the historic changelog into CHANGELOG.md ([issue #163](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/163)).
  - Only add required role in integration tests pipeline.
  - Updated the pipeline to use new deploy tasks.
  - Revert back to using the latest version of module Sampler for the pipeline ([issue #211](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/211)).
  - Fixed the sections in the GitHub issue and pull request templates to
    have a bit higher font size. This makes it easier to distinguish the
    section headers from the text.
- DnsRecordBase
  - Changed class to inherit properties from 'ResourcePropertiesBase`.
- xDnsRecordSrv
  - Now uses `[CimInstance]::new()` both in the resource code and the resource
    unit test to clone the existing DNS record instead of using the method
    `Clone()` that does not exist in PowerShell 7.
- xDnsServerSetting
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The mandatory parameter was replaced by the mandatory
    parameter `DnsServer`. This prevents the resource from being used twice
    in the same configuration using the same value for the parameter `DnsServer`
    ([issue #156](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/156)).
- xDnsServerDiagnostics
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The mandatory parameter was replaced by the mandatory
    parameter `DnsServer`. This prevents the resource from being used twice
    in the same configuration using the same value for the parameter `DnsServer`
    ([issue #157](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/157)).
- xDnsServerPrimaryZone
  - Now the property `Name` is always returned from `Get-TargetResource`
    since it is a `Key` property.
- xDnsServerForwarder
  - When providing an empty collection the resource will enforce that no
    forwarders are present.
- DnsRecordSrv
  - Changed logic for calculating the record's hostname

### Removed

- xDnsServer
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The DSC resource xDnsARecord was removed and are replaced
    by the DSC resource xDnsRecord.
  - Removing resource parameter information from README.md in favor of
    GitHub repository wiki.
  - Remove helper function `Remove-CommonParameter` in favor of the one in
    module _DscResource.Common_ ([issue #166](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/166)).
  - Remove helper function `ConvertTo-CimInstance` in favor of the one in
    module _DscResource.Common_ ([issue #167](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/167)).
  - Remove helper function `ConvertTo-HashTable` in favor of the one in
    module _DscResource.Common_ ([issue #168](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/168)).
- xDnServerSetting
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The properties `LogIPFilterList`, `LogFilePath`, `LogFileMaxSize`,
    and `EventLogLevel` have been removed. Use the resource _xDnsServerDiagnostics_
    with the properties `FilterIPAddressList`, `LogFilePath`, `MaxMBFileSize`,
    and `EventLogLevel` respectively to enforce these settings ([issue #190](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/190)).
    This is done in preparation to support more settings through the cmdlet
    `Get-DnsServerSetting` for the resource _xDnServerSetting_, and these
    values are not available through that cmdlet.

### Fixed

- xDnsServer
  - Enable Unit Tests to be run locally.

  - Fixed examples so the license information point to the correct default branch.

    if the record already exist, to compare the properties except `Ensure`
    in the desired state against the actual state ([issue #205](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer/issues/205)).
- xDnsServerDiagnostics
  - Fix EnableLogFileRollover Parameter name in README.

    ([issue 79](https://github.com/PowerShell/xDnsServer/issues/79)).
- xDnsServerZoneScope
  - Correctly returns the zone scope name when calling `Get-TargetResource`.
- xDnsServerForwarder
  - Now it is possible to just enforce the property `UseRooHint` without
    changing forwarders.
